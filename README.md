Dear Codurance,

Please accept my application for the Software Craftsman role. The values of pragmatism, professionalism and transparency that are described in your job description truly resonated with me. I have been following conferences like Brighton Ruby and any other craftsmanship programs I can put my hands on to constantly improve my coding abilities.

In the last two years, working professionally, I have practiced the skills of Test Driven Development, short feedback loops and pet projects to learn and experiment with new frameworks, libraries and languages. For example, I have recently started to write a mini-rails gem to understand the internals of the web framework that I use on a daily basis.

I am really happy to hear that the principles presented in Robert C Martinâ€™s Clean Code are applied daily at Codurance and I am looking forward to meeting Codurance engineers to share my perspective of what clean code looks like.

In the last two years I have worked in a service oriented architecture at Homeflow and I am looking forward to learning more about the challenges of different architecture styles like microservices, CQRS and Event Sourcing.

My favourite technology stack is Ruby - that is what I write day-to-day -  but I would be very excited to learn other languages in particular Node.JS.

Please see my attached CV. I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,


Tom Spencer
