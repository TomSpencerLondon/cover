# Tom Spencer 

Dear Codurance,

I am writing this letter as a formal application for the role of [apprentice at codurance](https://codurance.com/careers/become_an_apprentice/). The values of pragmatism, professionalism and transparency that are valued by your company truly resonated with me. I have been following conferences like Brighton Ruby and any other craftsmanship programs I can put my hands on to constantly improve my coding abilities.

My favourite technology stack is Ruby - that is what I write day-to-day -  but I would be very excited to learn other languages in particular Java and [C#](https://github.com/TomSpencerLondon/Number-Guesser). As part of my role at [Homeflow](https://www.homeflow.co.uk/) I have worked with Javascript, React and Backbone.

In the last two years, working professionally, I have practiced the skills of Test Driven Development, short feedback loops and pet projects to learn and experiment with new frameworks, libraries and languages. For example, I have recently started to write a mini-rails gem to understand the internals of the web framework that I use on a daily basis.

I am really happy to hear that the principles presented in Robert C Martinâ€™s Clean Code are applied daily at Codurance and I am looking forward to meeting Codurance engineers to share my perspective of what clean code looks like. Through my work at Homeflow I consistently aim to implement the principles of OOP and as a full-stack developer I frequently execute CRUD commands on our SQL and Postgres databases.

At Homeflow we have weekly sprints with opportunities for team self-reflection during weekly retros. I pair code with colleagues and prize the values of Extreme Programming and Software Craftsmanship principles. I am a keen proponent of TDD and am through my work at Homeflow I am acutely aware of need to strike a balance between integration and unit testing.

In the last two years I have worked in a service oriented architecture at Homeflow and I am looking forward to learning more about the challenges of different architecture styles like microservices, CQRS and Event Sourcing.

Please see my attached CV. I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

Tom Spencer
